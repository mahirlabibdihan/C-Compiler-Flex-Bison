With this ReadMe file there are two files:

scanner.l and parser.y are given. They are just a skeleton for your
help. Your .l and .y files will have a similar structure. Be careful
that you will need to add and change these skeletons as instructed in
class and assignment specification.

The scanner.l file may contain less patterns than you have already
done, so keep your own version, just follow the structure.

The parser.y file contains the C grammar you need to implement. You
will need to write the main function in parser.y as your coding
requirements.
